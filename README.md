# Oculus Development Resources

## A list of great resources

The Oculus Go is relatively new. As such, it can be difficult to find the documentation a starting developer needs to learn to make great VR experiences for it. The low entry-point of the Oculus Go created a new hobby for many aspiring developers, and this repo and its wiki aim to make easily available as many useful resources as possible to make this exciting journey easier.

## Wiki

Because of the convenience of a wiki, most of the resources will be organized in the wiki. Check the wiki for this repo to learn more.
