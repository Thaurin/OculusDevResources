# Oculus Development Resources

## Welcome!

The Oculus Go is relatively new. As such, it can be difficult to find the documentation a starting developer needs to learn to make great VR experiences for it. The low entry-point of the Oculus Go created a new hobby for many aspiring developers, and this repo and [its wiki](https://github.com/Thaurin/OculusDevResources/wiki) aim to make easily available as many useful resources as possible to make this exciting journey easier.

## A list of great development resources

Because of the convenience and public nature of GitHub Wikis, the resources will be organized in [the wiki](https://github.com/Thaurin/OculusDevResources/wiki). Check it out to start learning about Oculus Development resources!
